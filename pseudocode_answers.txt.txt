1. Why do programmers use psuedocode?

A: We use psuedocode as an informal language to help us brainstorm and write algorithms. It can be thought of as a kind of "universal" computer language that isn't tied to any real syntax; it is meant to be human to human. 

2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

A: Nothing, it cannot actually run.

3. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

A:

INPUT first number
INPUT second number
IF first number is greater than second number
	PRINT first number
IF second number is greater than first number
	PRINT second number
ELSE
	PRINT "The numbers are equal."
END IF

4. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

A:

INIT counter to 1
WHILE counter is less than or equal to 100
	PRINT counter
	ADD 1 to counter
END WHILE

5. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

A:

IMPORT phonebook
INPUT name
RETURN number associated with name

6. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

A: 

function phoneNumber() {
	let phoneBook = {
		'Ricky': '(123) 456-7891',
		'Julian': '(234) 567-8910',
		'Bubbles': '(345) 678-9101',
		'Cory': '(456) 789-1011',
		'Trevor': '(567) 891-0111',
		'Randy': '(678) 910-1112',
		'Jim': '(789) 101-1121'
	};
	var name = [prompt('Name?')];
	var number = phoneBook[name];
	return number;
	
}
