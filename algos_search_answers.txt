1. What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?

A: Going through a stack of unsorted record albums until you find the one you want.

2. What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?

A: The classic phonebook example isn't perfectly binary because we don't always go to the exact middle of the stack of pages but the idea of omitting a
chunk of the data holds up.

3. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?

A: 7

4. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?

A: 3

5. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

A: Binary search requires a sorted dataset so this would have to be linear.

6. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

A: Binary because it is way faster and the dataset is sorted.

7: You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.

A: For this specific case a linear search might actually be faster but assuming we might want to look up other words this binary solution will prevail.
function dictionarySearch(array, word) {
  var low = array[0];
  var high = array[array.length - 1];

  while (low <= high) {
    var mid = (array.indexOf(low) + array.indexOf(high)) / 2;
    mid = Math.round(mid);

    if (array[mid] > word) {
      high = array[mid - 1];
    } else if (array[mid] < word) {
      low = array[mid + 1];
    } else {
      return array[mid];
    }
  }
}


8: You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net
the right fish.

A: This linear solution assumes that we can keep track of the fish we've tried/move the ones that don't match to a separate tank, and that the spotted
fish exists since we can see him in the tank.
function getSpottedFish(fishList, spottedFish){
  for(let i=0; i<fishList.length; i++){
    if(fishList[i]==spottedFish){
      return spottedFish
    }
  }
}
